%This function is part of the UHEALscraper. It accepts the struct created
%by reading in the Interacoustics diagnostic suite .xml file by the
%function 'xml2struct.m' (Copyright (c) 2010, Wouter Falkena) and outputs a
%vastly simplified cell of the key audiogram data only.

%if several attempts are recorded (multible cells under the 'RecordedData'
%field), then the last one is taken.
